This is an interactive Solver for Myszkowski ciphers (mysz5.html) plus some supporting files so that it may be used as a packaged app for the Chrome web browser. The javascipt is in a separate file, mysz_main.js, so it will satisfy the CSP scheme for manifest version 2.

Ive subsequently posted this at Bionsgadgets.

This line was added from my Acer Chromebook to test if I can propagate it back to github and down to Asus chromebox.
